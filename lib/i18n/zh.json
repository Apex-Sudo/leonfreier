    "date": "February 2026 · Engagement ended amicably",
    "situation_title": "The Situation",
    "situation_p1": "The founder had deep infrastructure knowledge and a clear technical thesis: resell managed GPU compute to companies locked out of hyperscaler pricing. He could build the stack. What he couldn't see was the path from \"I have compute\" to \"I have a business.\"",
    "situation_p2": "When I came in, the positioning was scattered. Half B2C (\"the cooler AWS for young people\"), half B2B, with no clear first customer. Website looked AI-generated. No pricing validation. No discovery calls. No understanding of payment terms with his own supplier. He was about to spend his last money buying infrastructure before talking to a single prospect.",

    "step1_desc": "Repositioned the entire business from vague \"cool AWS for Gen Z\" to a specific, defensible position: B2B infrastructure for emerging markets, starting with Nigeria. One country. One value proposition. Economic nationalism as the wedge: \"Your data stays in Nigeria.\"",

    "stage3": "Identity layer. Emerges naturally from 30-50 companies authenticating through your stack. You don't build KYC. You observe the pattern and unify it. The identity graph becomes the moat.",
    "stage4": "App marketplace. Identity and payments solved. Third-party developers build on the stack because the hard problems are done. Transaction fees on every API call.",
    "step3_title": "Cash Flow Architecture",
    "step3_desc": "The founder was about to pay his infrastructure provider upfront. I redesigned the model: charge customers on the 1st, pay the supplier at end of month. Positive float from day one. Then reframed the supplier relationship entirely. The supplier needs demand generators. We are their next market. Negotiate from that position, not as a small buyer begging for credit.",
    "step4_title": "GTM Before Build",
    "step4_desc": "Stopped him from buying infrastructure before talking to a single prospect. Designed a discovery call sequence using his existing network. No cold outreach. Every call ends with \"Who should I talk to next?\" so the pipeline generates itself. The Mom Test applied: learn what they need, don't pitch what you have.",

    "step5_desc": "Full EOS implementation: vision, core values, quarterly rocks, weekly accountability. Plus a branded proposal system, consulting agreement, and interactive execution documents. One URL, everything in it.",
    "decision_title": "The Decision",
    "decision_p1": "After the alignment call, it became clear the engagement wouldn't work. Not because of capability on either side, but because of timing and priorities. The founder needed to resolve upstream questions before a strategic consulting layer would deliver value.",
    "decision_p2": "I told him directly. We parted on good terms. He wrote a LinkedIn recommendation the same day.",
    "decision_p3": "Walking away from revenue when you're pre-revenue yourself is not comfortable. But taking on an engagement where the prerequisites aren't met burns both parties. The consulting only works when the founder is ready to execute on the output.",
